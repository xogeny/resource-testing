# Purpose

This project is solely to be used as an example of a simple API.  I'll
be using it, in conjunction with another project, to demonstrate how
to wrap an existing API with a set of hypermedia wrappers.

Although I cannot imagine someone taking a serious interest in this
code, I just want to be explicit: you almost certainly don't want to
use this code for anything.
